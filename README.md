# multithreaded_examples
Examples of multithreaded code in various paradigms

## Standard Problems

1) hello: each thread prints its id and the number of threads
2) sumsqr: compute the sum of the first n squares
3) pi: compute pi 
4) sort: a parallel version of qsort
5) nqueens: compute the number of valid queen placements on an nxn board
6) nnt: compute the number theory transform


##OpenMP

  Makefile        simple makefile
  omp1.c          hello world, each thread prints its id
